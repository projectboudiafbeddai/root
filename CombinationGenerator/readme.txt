this is how my algorithm work "combinations generator"
it's interesting!huh! if you need more info about this graph
see about "graph theory"
example:
you have values (1,2,3,4,5,6)
and you want all possible combination for every set with just four '4' values the order of values doesn't matter,
for example there are six '6' possible options for someone and he mast just select four "4" option from that list , the question what is the possible combinations ?
all possible combinations it's:
1,2,3,4
1,2,3,5
1,2,3,6
1,2,4,5
1,2,4,6
1,2,5,6
1,3,4,5
1,3,4,6
1,3,5,6
1,4,5,6
2,3,4,5
2,3,4,6
2,3,5,6
2,4,5,6
3,4,5,6
it's very fast algorithm if you looking for the right way to do it. enjoy :D
the algorithm speed so far its :3,921,225 "C(100,4)" combinations in 0.37 sec
and "C(52,6)"=20,358,520 combinations in 1.58 sec
